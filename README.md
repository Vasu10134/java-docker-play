# java-docker-play 🚀

This project demonstrates how to containerize a simple Java application (`App.java`) using Docker. It includes a `Dockerfile` for building the Docker image and a `.gitignore` to exclude unnecessary files. The goal is to showcase how to easily deploy and run a Java application in an isolated Docker container.

## 🔧 Technologies Used:
- **Java**: Programming language used for the application.
- **Docker**: Containerization tool to run the Java app in an isolated environment.

## ⚙️ What We Do:
- Write a simple Java application (`App.java`)
- Create a Dockerfile to containerize the app
- Build and run the Java app in a Docker container

## 📦 Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository
2. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t java-docker-play .`
3. Run the container: `docker run java-docker-play`
